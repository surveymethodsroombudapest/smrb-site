Survey Methods Room Budapest is a research group at the Department of Statistics, Faculty of Social Sciences, ELTE. The main profile of SMRB is the methodological investigation of survey data collection and the use of survey analysis methodology to answer empirical social science questions. This includes studies on sampling, weighting, and estimation. We also work with probability and non-probability samples as well as questionnaire experiments. Our projects include the design, evaluation and validation of new data collections and the development of indicators based on survey data relevant to empirical social science.
