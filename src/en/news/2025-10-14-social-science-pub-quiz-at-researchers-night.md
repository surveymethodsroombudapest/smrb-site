On September 26, as part of the Researchers' Night program series, a fun evening event entitled "Social Science Pub Quiz - Estimation or Dishonesty? Measuring Political Public Opinion" took place at the Faculty of Social Sciences at ELTE.

Three teams compared their knowledge of the world of public opinion research at the quiz, with a total of eight enthusiastic participants.

The atmosphere was great, the questions worked well, and the participants were able to engage in exciting discussions on the topics of statistics, estimates, and political research.

Thank you to everyone who participated in the event!
