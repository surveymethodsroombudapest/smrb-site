Our research group has launched a new outreach website called **Survey Anatomy**, which presents key concepts of public opinion research in an accessible, non-technical way. The site is based on the results of our [2024-2025 EKA-funded project](https://surveymethodsroom.hu/en/projects/2024-02-24-election-forecast-from-survey-data/) and aims to help a wider audience understand how surveys are conducted, what kinds of biases may affect them, and how polling data should be interpreted.
