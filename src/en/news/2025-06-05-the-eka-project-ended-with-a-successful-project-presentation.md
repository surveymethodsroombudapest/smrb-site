In February 2025, our research group's project “***A new method to improve the accuracy of estimates in empirical social research: accessibility-based post-stratification***” (funded by the University Excellence Fund, EKA) was completed. More details about the project can be found [here](https://surveymethodsroom.hu/en/projects/2024-02-24-election-forecast-from-survey-data/).

On 27 May 2025, we organised a professional project presentation, where members of our research team presented the methodological results, main lessons learned and further possibilities of the research. The event was attended by a wide range of interested parties, including researchers, students and practitioners.

Presentation topics include:

* the main motivations and background of the research;
* the analysis of nonresponse;
* different weighting strategies;
* the evaluation of alternative data collection and estimation procedures.
