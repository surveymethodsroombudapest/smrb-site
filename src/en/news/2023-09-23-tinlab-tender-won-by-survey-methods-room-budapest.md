The ELTE National Laboratory for Social Innovation has extended our project “Public opinion research methods in a new technological and social environment” for another 1-year period. In the new research phase, we further explore the evaluation of online survey samples using simulation methods, making our results available to academic and market sectors in the form of an interactive dashboard. Our results will be published in early 2024. 

Details of the first phase of the project on “Public opinion research methods in a new technological and social environment” are available here.
