The Survey Methods Room Budapest was formed in September 2022 within the Department of Statistics, Faculty of Social Sciences, ELTE. The research group is led by Blanka Szeitl.

The main profile of the Room is the methodological analysis of survey researches: this includes studies related to sampling, weighting, biases and estimation. We also deal with probability and non-probability samples and survey experiments. Our research includes both design and evaluation of survey data collections.

Survey data collections have a central role in empirical social science, but the success of data collection is facing increasing technical and logistical difficulties. Within the Department of Statistics of the Faculty of Social Sciences, we are setting up an independent research group, in which several senior and junior researchers and students will work on long-term aspects related to the methodological criteria of survey research. The research group will only work on surveys (real data or simulations) that are derived from questionnaire data collection (i.e. we will not investigate big data). The objectives of the research group include embedding in the international scientific community, cooperation with universities and research groups, regular conference presentations, publications in foreign languages, and the organisation of workshops. All these activities are intended as an active and long-term contribution to the scientific work at the University. The research group also offers the opportunity for students of survey statistics and data analytics master's degree students of the faculty, as well as Hungarian and English language undergraduate students interested in survey research methodology, to participate in active research work
