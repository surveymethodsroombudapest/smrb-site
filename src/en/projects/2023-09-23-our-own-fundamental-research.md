Our research team is also launching independent projects on smaller topics. In 2023, we will be working on the following topics: 

1. The use of Respondent Driven Sampling in reaching the very high- and very low-income segments of the population. 
2. Predicting unit nonreponse with auxiliary variables. 
3. Measurability of usury lending.
