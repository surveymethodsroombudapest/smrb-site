The aim of the *ELTE Survey Reliability Criteria System* (Megbízhatósági Kritériumrendszer, MeKri) project is to **help assess the quality and generalizability of questionnaire databases used in social science research**. The project was initiated as a continuation of the [Public opinion research methods in a new technological and social environment II.](https://surveymethodsroom.hu/en/projects/2023-09-23-public-opinion-research-methods-in-a-new-technological-and-social-environment-ii/) research, which examined the reliability of online survey methodology among the Hungarian population. In this previous project, we analyzed – based on different data sources – the social characteristics along which online active respondents differ from the general population.

The aim of this project is to further develop and apply this knowledge in practice: to develop a structured set of criteria system available on an online platform, that will enable researchers and data users to evaluate the reliability of their own databases based on specific criteria. At the current phase of the project, the theoretical framework of the reliability criteria system and the first version of the evaluation criteria have been completed, and the development of the prototype of the related online interface is in progress. Our research group is conducting internal pilot tests to verify the operation of the system, and external testing with professional partners is also in preparation. In the next period, the aim is to finalize the interface, refine the criteria system based on feedback and launch the system to the social science research community.
