*Survey Anatomy* is an easy-to-understand online knowledge base that helps us better understand the operation, methodological background and limitations of public opinion polls. The [surveyanatomia.web.app](surveyanatomia.web.app) website, currently available in Hungarian, was created by two members of our research team to present in a clear and understandable way how a survey is constructed, what biases may appear during the response process, how weighting is done, and what to look out for when interpreting public opinion survey results. The website aims to bring social science methodology closer to the public and support critical data interpretation – especially in situations where public opinion surveys serve as a basis for political, social or economic decisions.

*Survey Anatomy* was originally launched as a side project of the [Election forecast from survey data](https://surveymethodsroom.hu/en/projects/2024-02-24-election-forecast-from-survey-data/) research, but has now grown into a separate initiative. In the future, our research team will continue to work on the long-term development of the site: our goal is to add new content and interactive elements to help provide easy-to-understand information about social data collection and its interpretation.
