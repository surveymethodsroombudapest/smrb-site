This project is a continuation of the research “Public opinion research methods in a new technological and social environment I.” Based on Hungarian population parameters (regional internet penetration data, composite respondent attitudes and socio-demographic composition estimates), we will implement the international guidelines necessary for the correct and reliable conduct of research using online questionnaire data collection and data interpretation. Simulation studies will be carried out in order to highlight research questions for which online survey data can be used and the topics for which it may be misleading. Using face-to-face survey data, we define theoretical subsamples of the population available offline and online and evaluate the estimates derived from these. This phase of the research will summarize the simulation results in a complex dashboard and make them interactively available to both academia and civil society.
